# 🌍 PCA-Based Country Analysis & Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Machine Learning techniques to analyze country-level socio-economic data.

The main goal was to:
- Reduce dimensionality using PCA
- Discover hidden patterns in the data
- Identify clusters of countries with similar characteristics
- Build a machine learning pipeline for analysis
- This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a real-world data science pipeline.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains country-level indicators such as:
- Child mortality
- Exports
- Health spending
- Imports
- Income
- Inflation
- Life expectancy
- Total fertility
- GDP per capita

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Data normalization

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature relationships
- Outlier detection

### 3️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- Applied Principal Component Analysis
- Reduced feature space to principal components
- Explained variance analysis
- Visualization of countries in reduced dimensions

### 4️⃣ Clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering on PCA-transformed data
- Identified groups of similar countries
- Analyzed cluster centers and characteristics
